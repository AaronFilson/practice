# practice
This is a practice repository to prepare for a new life in coding and development.

I am learning how to use git and GitHub to manage and version control code in a distributed and lightweight fashion. This is will assist me in getting up to speed on modern technologies such as HTML5 and CSS3. With practice and the instruction of Code Fellows, I will have the opportunity to rejoin the world of software and high tech.
